Managing relational databases 
or really just calling data from a excelsheet

I will be using the Facebook Data set I cleaned and parsed to show the example.



First and foremost, SQL is easy to understand if you understand the syntax behind it, that being said I am not a jedi in the art of SQL, always a learner


with SQL you can modify datasets, indexing structures, and retrieve data from these databases.

"Views" "Indexes" and "Reports"

CREATE VIEW Syntax

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

###literally just plain text, not assembly code or python.
