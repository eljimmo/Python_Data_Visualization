Managing relational databases 
or really just calling data from a excelsheet

I will be using the Facebook Data set I cleaned and parsed to show the example.



First and foremost, SQL is easy to understand if you understand the syntax behind it, that being said I am not a jedi in the art of SQL, always a learner


with SQL you can modify datasets, indexing structures, and retrieve data from these databases.


"Views" "Indexes" and "Reports"

CREATE VIEW Syntax

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

CREATE INDEX Example

CREATE INDEX idx_lastname
ON Persons (LastName);

1. Establishing Data Mining Goals (clarifying the objective | identify the key questions | levels of accuracy from data mining)
2. Selecting Data (Output of mining exercise depends upon quality used)
3. Preprocessing Data (Raw data is messy, error prone, missing info, integrity checks)
4. Transforming Data (Appropriate format in which data must be stored | reduce the number of attributes needed to explain the phenomena |  transforming data Data reduction algorithms,
such as Principal Component Analysis | continous variables might fit into categorical variables (eg income) where infomation might better explain non-linear behaviors)
5. Mining Data (analysis methods, including parametric and non-parametric methods, machine-learning algorithms, etc..)
6 Evaluate and Disseminate results



Principal Component Analysis

####https://builtin.com/data-science/step-step-explanation-principal-component-analysis

PCA = reduction method to reduce the dimensionality of large data,
transforming a large data variables into a smaller variables that still contains most of the information in the large set.

STANDARDIZATION, +  COVARIANCE MATRIX COMPUTATION, = IDENTIFYING THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS of a large data set. 

In Sample Forecasts = "testing of algorithm predictive capabilities"
